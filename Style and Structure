Pycodestyle: used to check code against common style criteria for Python.

For such reasons, the Python style guide recommends keeping all lines of code to a maximum of 79 characters in length—or even 72 characters, in some cases.

Again, this works because Python does implicit line continuation with anything inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.

Going forward, we'll sometimes need to be printing a lot of very long strings—so this will be our go-to way of handling that.

This may all seem a bit odd, and we'd agree—it is a little weird to have to give so much thought to something as simple as how to get a sentence split across multiple lines. But it'll be important if we want to keep our code from getting horribly messy and impossible to read!
