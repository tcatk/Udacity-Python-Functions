TIMES TEN CALCULATION
import turtle
def times_ten(number):
  return number * 10

emily = turtle.Turtle()
distane = times_ten(5)
emily.forward(distance)

When we say that it "returns the number 10" what we mean is this: This code works the same as if the function call, simple_function(), were replaced by the number 10.

In other words, this ...

distance = simple_function()

... is equivalent to this:

distance = 10

So a return statement takes a value and returns it back to the place from which the function was called.

WEIRD SHAPE:

import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.color("white")
t.width(1)
t.speed(0)
t.hideturtle()

def square(number):
    return number * number

for n in range(540):
    angle = square(n)
    t.right(angle + .5)
    t.forward(5)

RETURNING A TURTLE:

import turtle

def super_reptile():
    leonardo = turtle.Turtle()
    leonardo.color("blue")
    leonardo.width(20)
    return leonardo

clark = super_reptile()
clark.forward(100)
clark.left(45)
clark.forward(100)
# up, up, and away!
